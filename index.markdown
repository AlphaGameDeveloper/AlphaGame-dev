{% capture about_content %}
<p>I'm a high school student with a deep and growing passion for software development, networking, system administration, and all things tech. I love building innovative solutions and exploring emerging technologies that challenge me to grow as a developer.</p>

<p>In my free time, I work on personal projects and contribute to <a target="_blank" href="https://penguinempirerobotics.org/">Penguin Empire Robotics</a>, my schoolâ€™s robotics team, where I design and develop software to support our competitions and team operations.</p>

<p>I also lead the Youth Technology Ministry at my church, where I manage audio/visual systems, develop and maintain websites, create social media content, and write custom software for the Youth Group and Confirmation programs.</p>
